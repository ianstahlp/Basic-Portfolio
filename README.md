# Basic-Portfolio

This is just my portfolio page for employment purposes. It's nothing special and I mostly just wanted it to be as straightforward as possible without too many complications. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~

About Me
--------

	This page consists of short bio about what I'm doing with the coding as well as some light fluff.

Portfolio
---------

	This has all my projects all in one place.

	I added an overflow to allow a universal clean look. I didn't want to have any sort of page scolling. There isn't much else to it other than that. 

Contact
-------

	This consists some basic input elements as well as a <other> thing. When I learn some back-end development, I'll make sure to let this actually show up somewhere so it's not being sent to nothing. Should probably add a means of going to a new page when the submit button is pressed. In addition to that, I would also like to design the submit button as well, but that will be for another time. 

Overall
-------

	A large part of the actualy design and color scheme came from a tutorial I followed that allowed the header to hug the edges of the page rather than have an annoying gap between the header and the page. I didn't want that at all. Because of this tutorial, I also learned some creative ways to use <ul> and <ol> and interesting ways. Such as allow some universal gapping between the <li> elements. 

	There is a footer that is fixed in it's position.

Problems that must be addressed
------------------------------- 

	Some debugging problems that I haven't been able to get around to have been the a weird inconsistency between my About Me page and the other two main pages. I'll get aroudn to fixing it at another time, but as it currently stands, I have not been able to get around to it due to other responsiblities. 

	I would like to add some more interactivitiy with my navigation buttons. They're static. I would like to add something to it rather than just the hover commands that I haven't quite mastered at the moment.
