					<p>I am currently a student in a UCLA extentions program, focusing on web development. My goal is to make this a career, perhaps through an already thriving business or through a start-up, regardless, I would like to do this full-time. Currrently, I'm employed by two companies, first being PhoShow, a vietnamese restaurant, and Sprouts, a grocery store. My hope is to gain the necessary skills to provide employment and continue on this path as a web developer/ app developer. </p>

					<p>In addition, I like to play video games as if it were a drug. You can imagine how I feel not having the ability to play them currently. I'm having withdrawals. Help</p>
